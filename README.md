Our website is built using [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). We use [next-intl](https://next-intl.dev/) to provide localization.

## Getting started

To get started, first install the npm dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.

## Customizing

You can start editing this website by modifying the files in the `/src` folder. The site will auto-update as you edit these files.
